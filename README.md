# Recipe Youtube Guide
We created a group project where we will be creating a website which allows us to search for recipes. Once we select a meal we will be given a recipe for that mean and video suggestions from Youtube for a tutorial.


## Description

We've created and completed a to-do list on what the MVP is of our project, which includes:

- a header to show an explanantion of what the site is
- a footer created by team members etc
- a search bar to search for recipes
- the recipes show based on whats been searched (recipe api)
- a submit button
- implementation of videos
- we click on a recipe -> a youtube video on a seperate link/tab (youtube api)
- storing what weve searched for
- ensure we use bootstrap
- deployed on a GitHub page
- be interactive and responsive
- have polished UI
- uses modals instead of prompts, confrims and alerts

Impovements once MVP is achieved:
  
- we click on a recipe and then we are shown a youtube video within the same html
- a favourites section for recipes
- suggestions for searching for recipes based on what is typed... like "chi" ... "chicken pasta, chicken pie etc"
